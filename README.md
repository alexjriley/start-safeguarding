## User Experience (UX)

See user stories below...

### User Stories

1. As a concerned citizen, I want to quickly understand what safeguarding means, So that I can be informed about how it applies in everyday situations.

2. As someone who suspects a safeguarding issue, I want to easily identify signs of abuse or neglect, So that I can take appropriate action or seek help.

3. As a first-time visitor to the site, I want the homepage to clearly highlight the importance of safeguarding, So that I immediately grasp the relevance and urgency of the topic.

4. As a person looking to report a safeguarding concern, I want access to a simple contact form or list of key contacts, So that I can reach the right people without confusion or delay.

5. As someone unfamiliar with safeguarding procedures, I want to see clear, step-by-step action points, So that I know exactly what to do if I encounter a safeguarding issue.

## Design

I based my design on this clean and accessible site which makes use of bootstrap whilst maintaining a brand voice and making use of its grid system. (https://sandywyper.github.io/safeguarding/#what-is).

### Colour Scheme

My colour scheme was: 

    --primary-color: #6A5ACD; /* Purple */
    --secondary-color: #2a2a2a; /* Black */
    --accent-color: #FF6F61; /* Coral */
    --background-color: #F2F2F2; /* Mist Grey */

The site needed a light theme to balance the subject matter. I used a primary-color of purple to differentiate from blue as a typical health or professional colour.

### Typography

I used two free Google fonts [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) which paired well and prioritised accessibility over style.

    --primary-font: "Quicksand";
    --secondary-font: "Nunito";

I wanted to used distinct fonts from the typical Arial or Monsterrat feel to give the website a brand identity.

### Imagery

I used imagery from the royalty free site Pexels. I consciously avoided AI generated images of people which can be disturbing.

I used Chat GPT to generate a simple logo to style the navbar.

### Wireframes

I made a simple mobile first and web wireframe using Canva.
